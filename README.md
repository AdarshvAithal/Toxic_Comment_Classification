# Comment Toxicity Classification Application

This is a machine learning-based application designed to detect and classify toxic comments from user inputs. The application uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to categorize comments into toxic and non-toxic labels. It is built to help detect harmful content in online platforms, improving the quality of user interactions.

## Features
- Classifies comments as **toxic** or **non-toxic** based on text input.
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of labeled comments.
- Provides accurate predictions in real-time.
- Easy integration with web and mobile applications for content moderation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for building the application.
- **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** for machine learning model implementation.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling and processing.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdarshAithal/Comment-Toxicity-classication.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



## Usage

1. Input a comment into the application interface.
2. The model will classify the comment as **toxic** or **non-toxic**.
3. View the classification results displayed on the interface.

## Model

- **Dataset**: The model is trained on a large dataset containing a variety of toxic and non-toxic comments.
- **Approach**: We use techniques like tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to prepare the data. The machine learning model is trained using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning techniques like LSTM, depending on the complexity required.
